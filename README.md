## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+ and npm

Install and run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build and preview production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment (Netlify)

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`

Forms & reCAPTCHA:

- The contact form uses Netlify Forms with a honeypot and `data-netlify-recaptcha`.
- The reCAPTCHA widget is injected by Netlify on a deployed site (it may not render in plain local dev). Use a deployed preview or `netlify dev` to test end-to-end.
- Configure notifications in the Netlify dashboard under Forms.

## Editing Content

- Update your details, links, and section content in the React components and JSON content files (e.g., skills, publications, projects).
- Replace the avatar and assets in `public/` as needed.
